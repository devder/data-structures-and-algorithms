## How do you improve at problem solving?

- Understand the problem
- Devise a plan
- Break it down
- Master common problem solving patterns
- Write pseudocode
- Learn to think abstractly
- Refactor and optimize

## DEVISE A PLAN

### Understand the Problem

- Can you restate the problem in your own words?
- What are the inputs that go into the problem?
- What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
- Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem.)
- How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

### Explore Concrete Examples

- start with simple examples
- progress to more complex examples
- explore examples with empty inputs
- explore examples with invalid inputs

### Break It Down

- Explicitly write out the steps you need to take

### Solve or Simplify

- Solve the problem if you can
- If you can't, solve a simpler problem
- Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do
- Temporarily ignore that difficulty
- Write a simplified solution
- Then incorporate that difficulty back in

### Look Back and Refactor

- Can you check the result?
- Can you derive the result differently?
- Can you understand it at a glance?
- Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
- Can you improve the performance of your solution?
- Can you think of other ways to refactor?
- How have other people solved this problem?

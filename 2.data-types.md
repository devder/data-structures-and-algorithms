## Objects

- Unordered k:v pairs
- Use when you need fast lookups, insertions and removals
- When you don't need order

### Big O of Objects

- Insertion: O(1)
- Removal: O(1)
- Searching: O(n) // searching is when you want to find a value, not a key. for eg: is there a value 100 in the object?
- Access: O(1)

## Arrays

- When you need order

### Big O of Arrays

- Insertion: It depends
  - At the end: O(1)
  - At the beginning: O(n) // because all the elements need to be re-indexed
- Removal: It depends
  - At the end: O(1)
  - At the beginning: O(n) // because all the elements need to be re-indexed
- Searching: O(n)
- Access: O(1)

## Array Methods

- push: O(1)
- pop: O(1)
- shift: O(n) // this is to remove the first element
- unshift: O(n) // this is to add an element at the beginning
- concat: O(n)
- slice: O(n)
- splice: O(n)
- sort: O(n \* log(n))
- forEach/map/filter/reduce/etc.: O(n)
- indexOf: O(n)
- includes: O(n)

What does better code mean?

- Faster
- Less memory
- Readable
- Scalable

## Big O Definition

- We say that an algorithm is O(f(n)) if the number of simple operations the computer has to do is eventually less than a constant times f(n), as n increases. where n is the size of the input and f is a function of n.
- The Big O notation can be time complexity or space complexity depending on what we are measuring.
- f(n) could be:
  - constant (f(n) = 1),
  - logarithmic (f(n) = log(n)) (binary search)
    log(8) = 3 because 2^3 = 8
    log (25) = 5 because 2^5 = 32
    log (64) = 6 because 2^6 = 64
  - linear (f(n) = n),
  - linearithmic (f(n) = n \* log(n)) (merge sort, quick sort)
  - quadratic (f(n) = n^2), (nested loops)
  - cubic (f(n) = n^3),
    ** the above are in order of reducing efficiency **

### time complexity

- How many operations are being performed?
  - 2 \* 3 = 1 operation
- How does the runtime grow as the input grows?

### space complexity

- How much memory is being used?
- How does the memory grow as the input grows?
